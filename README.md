# Multi-class-Classification-of-Dry-Beanss
This project aims to classify different types of dry beans using a Neural Network model trained on the Dry Bean Dataset. The Dry Bean Dataset contains various features of dry beans, such as area, perimeter, major and minor axis lengths, and shape factors. By leveraging the power of TensorFlow, the model achieves an accuracy of 92% on test data.
